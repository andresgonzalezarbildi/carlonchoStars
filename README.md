## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third party APIs

Using DeckOfCards API i made a simple game, which gives you two cards, and then lets you choose whether you wanna bet or not if a third card will be in the middle of those or not.

## Optimizations
The design is barely just whats necessary to play, theres no function to gamble and keep track of points or money


## Lessons Learned:

Learned a lot abouut APIs, how to read third party documentation, and even though i didnt use it this time, how to use localStorage to store data.
